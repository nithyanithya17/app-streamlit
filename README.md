#  Titanic Survival Prediction App

An interactive **Streamlit web application** that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using a trained machine learning model.  
This project covers the complete ML pipeline — from data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to deployment on Streamlit Cloud.
